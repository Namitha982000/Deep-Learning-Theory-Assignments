    "**1. What are the advantages of a CNN over a fully connected DNN for image classification?**\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) have several advantages over fully connected DNNs (Deep Neural Networks) for image classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Local connectivity: CNNs are designed to exploit the spatial structure of images. They use local connectivity and weight sharing, which means that the same filter is applied at different positions in the image. This allows CNNs to detect local features, such as edges and corners, regardless of their position in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Translation invariance: Since the same filters are applied at different positions in the image, CNNs can detect features regardless of their location. This makes them translation invariant, meaning that they can recognize the same object regardless of its position in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Parameter sharing: CNNs use parameter sharing, which means that the same set of weights is used for different parts of the image. This significantly reduces the number of parameters required by the model, making it more memory efficient and easier to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hierarchical feature extraction: CNNs use multiple layers of filters to extract increasingly complex features from the image. The lower layers detect simple features like edges and corners, while the higher layers detect more abstract features like shapes and objects. This hierarchical feature extraction allows CNNs to learn representations that are more meaningful for the task of image classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Reduced overfitting: CNNs can reduce overfitting by using techniques such as dropout and data augmentation. Dropout randomly drops out some of the neurons during training, which forces the network to learn more robust features. Data augmentation artificially increases the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the images, which helps prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, CNNs are more suited to image classification tasks than fully connected DNNs due to their ability to exploit the spatial structure of images, their translation invariance, parameter sharing, hierarchical feature extraction, and ability to reduce overfitting."

The lowest layer outputs 100 feature maps, the middle one outputs 200, and the top one outputs 400. The input images are RGB images of 200 × 300 pixels. What is the total number of parameters in the CNN? If we are using 32-bit floats, at least how much RAM will this network require when making a prediction for a single instance?

    "If your GPU runs out of memory while training a CNN, there are several things you could try to solve the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reduce the batch size: Using smaller batches can reduce the memory required to store the intermediate activations and gradients during backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reduce the size of the model: You can try reducing the number of layers, filters, or neurons in your model to decrease its memory footprint.\n",

    "**4. Why would you want to add a max pooling layer rather than a convolutional layer with the same stride?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Max pooling layers and convolutional layers with the same stride can both be used to downsample the spatial dimensions of feature maps. However, max pooling has some advantages over convolution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parameter efficiency: Max pooling requires no parameters, while convolutional layers require a set of learnable filters. This means that max pooling layers can be used to reduce the spatial dimensionality of feature maps without increasing the number of model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Invariance: Max pooling can help to increase the invariance of the model to translations in the input image. This is because the maximum value in a pooling region will stay the same even if the input image is shifted slightly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Non-linearity: Max pooling introduces a non-linearity into the model. This can be useful for increasing the expressive power of the model and helping it to learn complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Lower memory requirements: Max pooling layers typically require less memory than convolutional layers with the same stride, as they only need to keep track of the maximum value in each pooling region rather than a set of learnable filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in some cases, convolutional layers with the same stride may be preferred over max pooling. For example, if the goal is to preserve spatial information as much as possible, then convolutional layers with the same stride may be more appropriate. Additionally, in some cases, global average pooling may be preferred over max pooling as a way of downsampling feature maps, as it can be more effective at capturing the global structure of the feature maps."

    "**5. When would you want to add a local response normalization layer?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The local response normalization (LRN) layer is typically used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to introduce a form of lateral inhibition, which can improve the generalization ability of the network. Specifically, it can help reduce overfitting by encouraging the network to learn more diverse and discriminative filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LRN layer computes the response of a neuron by normalizing its activity based on the activities of its neighboring neurons within the same feature map. This normalization can help the network learn more robust features by enhancing the contrast between the responses of different neurons. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the LRN layer is often used in conjunction with other regularization techniques, such as dropout and weight decay, to further improve the generalization performance of the network. It is most commonly used in image classification tasks, such as the ImageNet challenge. However, it has become less popular in recent years as other regularization techniques have shown better results."
